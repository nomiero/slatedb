//! `io_uring`-backed implementation of [`LocalCacheStorage`].
//!
//! Routes every cache read and write through a dedicated OS thread that owns
//! a single `io_uring` instance, instead of dispatching each `pread`/`write`
//! through `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. The blocking pool is shared by
//! every other consumer in the process; on a busy machine its threads land
//! anywhere the kernel will schedule them, including cores running
//! compaction. That contention is what causes the residual reader-throughput
//! dips even when the working set is fully page-cached. Pinning all cache
//! I/O onto a dedicated worker removes that scheduler-level coupling.
//!
//! Linux-only. The module is only compiled in on `target_os = "linux"`; the
//! constructor on other platforms is wired so that `use_io_uring` silently
//! falls back to [`super::FsCacheStorage`].
